\chapter{Acknowledgments}

  First and foremost, I am grateful for a truly exceptional committee consisting of my chair, Laura
  Veldkamp, and committee members Thomas Sargent, Michael Waugh, and Stan Zin. They have each played
  a unique role in my development as an economist by helping me learn to direct my curiosity,
  teaching me the tools needed to do economic research, and by providing encouragement when I wasn't
  sure which steps were next. My life is greatly improved because of the time they were willing to
  share with me.

  Dave Backus, though no longer with us, also played a vital role in my development as an economist
  and as a person --- I often miss him and frequently reflect on the lessons I learned from him.

  I am grateful for the collaborative environment that I was able to work in while here at NYU and
  am lucky to have learned an incredible number of things from various students and professors,
  including, but not limited to, Felipe Alvarez, Katka Borovickova, Tom Cooley, Richard Davies,
  Fiona Feng, Axelle Ferriere, Sonia Gilbukh, Victoria Gregory, Timothy Hills, Malika Krishna,
  Elliot Lipnowski, Roxana Mihet, Simon Mongey, Jonathan Payne, Alberto Polo, Kim Ruhl, Maher Said,
  Daniel Stackman, Balint Szoke, Venky Venkateswaran, Larry White, and Peifan Wu.

  The Sargent Reading Group has served as an effective tool for me to learn about a wide range of
  topics in economics --- I am grateful to those who have helped organize it each while I attended
  (Joseba Martinez and Balint Szoke) and to each of the particants who took it seriously by coming
  prepared with interesting papers and asking insightful, though sometimes difficult, questions.

  Outside of NYU, I have also benefitted from a number of wonderful colleagues, including, but not
  limited to, Rick Evans, Lilia Maliar, Serguei Maliar, Matt McKay, Kerk Phillips, Jim Savage, Simon
  Scheidegger, John Stachurski, and Natasha Watkins.

  This work is dedicated to my wife, Jessica Coleman, and my parents, Gregory and Stephanie Coleman.
  Each of these three individuals have encouraged me in my education, driven and motivated my
  curiosity, and supported the paths that these pursuits have lead me to take, often at the price of
  their own convenience.

\chapter{Abstract}

  \DoubleSpacing

  This dissertation consists of three chapters. These chapters focus on

  Chapter 1, `Pareto weights as wedges in two-country models`, was written with Dave Backus, Axelle
  Ferriere, and Spencer Lyon. In this chapter we study how in models with recursive preferences,
  endogenous variation in Pareto weights would be interpreted as wedges from the perspective of a
  frictionless model with additive preferences. We describe the behavior of the relative Pareto
  weight in a two-country world and explore its interaction with consumption and the real exchange
  rate.

  Chapter 2, `Global Solution Methods for Macroeconomic Models`, was written jointly with Spencer
  Lyon, Lilia Maliar, and Serguei Maliar. This chapter first discusses 7 global solution methods in
  the context of a simple neoclassical growth model and then introduces a new 8th global solution
  method in the context of a non-trivial New-Keynesian model. We first highlight how algorithm
  choice, even more than programming language, plays an important role in the speed that a model can
  be solved. The new method introduced in this paper is capable of solving a New-Keynesian model
  with an 8-dimensional state-space in mere seconds which makes it possible to perform model
  calibration.

  In Chapter 3, `The Cost of Income-Driven Repayment for Student Loans,' I investigate a form of
  student loan repayment known as income-driven repayment. This type of loan repayment has received
  a significant amount of political support recently in the U.S. and there are new proposals that
  would make it so that all future student loans would be repaid under income-driven plans. I use a
  detailed model that incorporates pre, intra, and post college decisions to explore how
  income-driven might change enrollment and debt accumulation decisions, and how these changes might
  affect the required government subsidy to support the student loan program. I find that
  income-driven repayment would increase the cost of running the student loan program by 15\% and
  that a significant portion of this cost comes from debt accumulated by those who are unlikely to
  graduate from college.
