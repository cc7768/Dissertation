\section{Overcoming Moral Hazard}

One reason that students take out larger levels of debt under IBR plans is that there is a
disconnect between the level of debt and the monthly payment. A natural way to address this
disconnect is to find ways that we can reconnect the level of debt with the size of the monthly
payments. In this section we try to maintain some of the income contingency of the IDR plans by not
expecting individuals who make below \$XX,XXX to make full payments on their loans. Instead, we ask
that the individuals pay (YY\% >> 10\%) of their income until the amortized amount for the first 5
years and amortize the remaining debt over the next 10 years.

This provides individuals income contingency early in their careers where they need it the most, but
ensures that they will internalize the cost of their debt since they will still eventually be
expected to repay the loan.
